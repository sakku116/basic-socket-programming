# basic-socket-programming
learn socket programming from Tech With Tim youtube channel, but its simplified i think.

## get started
- first, run the server.py. 
  
  `python server.py`
  
- and then run the client.py. but, running client.py need an argument that contain ip_address that server running in. 
  
  `python client.py [ip_address]`

>client.py can be run multiple times to create another instances/client. 
>it also can be run on different devices since the server was running on localhost.
